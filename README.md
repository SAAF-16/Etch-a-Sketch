# Etch-a-Sketch
project from The Odin Project program (www.theodinproject.com)

## Live Page
https://saaf-16.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/

## What is the page doing
The page is an example of a sketch board, i'ts possible to draw on the board while also changing dynamically size of the grid, transition effects, color , show/hide grid and the background color. All this made in an enjoyable UI

## What i learned
In this project i applied all my actual knoledge (16/03/2021), i'm now more familiar with the use of variable and the correct positioning of the various objects. the most tricky part was understanding how to make the color darker everytime that a tile is hovered multiple times,thing that i solved using hsl values and solved the performance issues using the div value instead of using the text as a counter
