# Etch-a-Sketch
Project from The Odin Project program (www.theodinproject.com)

## Live Page
https://saaf-16.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/

## What is the page doing
The page is an example of a sketch board, i'ts possible to draw on the board while also changing dynamically size of the grid, transition effects, color , show/hide grid and the background color. It also implements the functionality of making a tile more dark after every hover. All this made in an enjoyable UI

## What i learned
In this project i applied all my actual knoledge (16/03/2021), i'm now more familiar with the use of variables, creating objects dynamically and the different positioning technique to position various objects. The most tricky part was understanding how to make the color darker everytime that a tile is hovered multiple times,thing that i solved using hsl values and solved the performance issues using the div value instead of using the text as a counter
